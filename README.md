# Employee Salary Table

## Description

This is the challenge for Unit 3 of the DU Fullstack Bootcamp. This is a webpage that collects the full name and salary of employees and displays the information in a table. The employees are sorted alphabetically using their last names. The console will also display the average salary of the total number of employees and also choose a random employee as the winner of the company lottery.

This project helped me understand arrays and objects and how they interact with eachother. I also learned that some of the function calls need to be empty if I am declaring the main variable in use a global variable, or the function will call a new variable locally and it will interfere with my dataset.

## Usage

The following images show the prompts as they appear for user input of the employee's first name, their last name, and their salary. This is followed by a confirmation prompt to ask if the user would like to add another employee:

The following image shows an example of the webpage when all the employees have been added and it displays the average salary along with a random employee. The 'Add Employees' button was pressed multiple times to exhibit the random employee generator:
